# Rspamd-spamness

**Rspamd-spamness** is a Thunderbird add-on that visualizes spam scores generated by [Rspamd](https://rspamd.com) on the server side, which are embedded in message headers.

## Introduction

The **Rspamd-spamness** add-on is designed primarily for mail system administrators who utilize Rspamd, a high-performance spam filtering system. This add-on provides a visual representation of spam scores, allowing administrators to monitor and manage spam filtering more effectively across their email services. While its main audience is mail system administrators, the add-on also helps email users in identifying potentially spammy emails by highlighting their assigned scores.

"Rspamd-spamness adds columns to the thread pane (message list) and a header to the message pane. The size and saturation of a circle reflect larger or smaller spam scores.")

## Supported mail headers

The add-on utilizes the following headers:

- **Extended Rspamd headers** added by the [Rspamd proxy worker](https://rspamd.com/doc/workers/rspamd_proxy.html) (`X-Spamd-Result`).
- **Headers added by [Haraka](http://haraka.github.io/plugins/rspamd)** (`X-Rspamd-Score` and `X-Rspamd-Report`) from version 0.9.1.
- **Headers added by Exim** (`X-Spam-Score` and `X-Spam-Report`) from version 0.8.0.

To enable extended spam headers in the [Milter headers module](https://rspamd.com/doc/modules/milter_headers.html), add the following line to `local.d/milter_headers.conf`:

~~~
extended_spam_headers = true;
~~~

To enable headers in Exim, refer to the "Integration with Exim MTA" section of the [MTA integration](https://rspamd.com/doc/tutorials/integration.html) document.

To enable extended spam headers in [Rmilter](https://www.rspamd.com/rmilter) (deprecated), add the following line to `rmilter.conf`:

~~~
spamd {
...
        extended_spam_headers = yes;
};
~~~

### Third-party spam filters

The add-on (from version 0.9.0) also supports SpamAssassin-based spam filters (e.g., `SpamAssassin`, `MailScanner`). The support is limited to displaying the total message score in the column.

### Headers processing order

The add-on searches for a spam score header in the message, following this order: user-defined `Additional mail headers` (if specified in the `Advanced options`), then hardcoded default headers (`X-Spamd-Result`, `X-Spam-Score`, `X-Rspamd-Score`, `X-Spam-Status`, `X-MailScanner-SpamCheck`). If a matched header is found, the add-on will stop searching for additional headers, even if a score cannot be detected in the identified header.

## Installation

To install the **Rspamd-spamness** add-on, choose one of the following options:

- Download the [latest release](https://github.com/moisseev/rspamd-spamness/releases/latest) directly from the [Releases](https://github.com/moisseev/rspamd-spamness/releases) page.
- Access versions reviewed by `moz://a` on the [Thunderbird Add-ons page](https://addons.thunderbird.net/thunderbird/addon/rspamd-spamness/).
- If you need to install a specific commit, you can [create an XPI installer](#creating-an-xpi-installer) from the source code.

### Reindexing folders

After installation, you will need to reindex your email folders that contain Rspamd-scored mail and enable the display of score and indicator columns for each folder. If you installed **Rspamd-spamness** before setting up your email accounts, you can skip the rest of this section — you're all set.

To reindex a folder:

1. Select the folder you wish to reindex.
2. Right-click on the folder and choose `Properties` (or select `Edit` from the Menu Bar and then `Folder Properties`).
3. Click the `Repair Folder` button.

Repeat these steps for each folder containing Rspamd-scored mail.

### Displaying the score and indicator columns

To add score and indicator columns to your Message List:

1. Click the column picker (the small icon located in the column header area).
2. Select the appropriate columns from the list.

To apply these column settings to all folders in your account:

1. Click the column picker again.
2. Scroll down to `Apply columns to...`, select `Folder and its children...`, and then choose the top folder of your account.

## Training Rspamd

One of the methods for training Rspamd involves collecting emails in special IMAP folders and processing them with a script that calls `rspamc`.

You can enable toolbar buttons to move or copy messages to the training spam/ham folders on the add-on settings page.

You will also need to specify the locations of your training folders.

## Creating an XPI installer

The `XPI` installation package is essentially a `ZIP` file with a different extension.

To create it, zip the contents of the add-on's directory (not the add-on directory itself), excluding hidden files and folders that begin with a period. Then, rename the ZIP file to have an `.xpi` extension (or simply drag and drop the ZIP into the `Add-ons Manager` tab).

The ZIP file should maintain the following structure:

~~~
rspamd-spamness-master.zip
├── chrome/
├── defaults/
├── chrome.manifest
├── install.rdf
└── ... (other files and directories)
~~~

And **not** this structure:

~~~
rspamd-spamness-master.zip
└── rspamd-spamness-master/
    ├── chrome/
    ├── defaults/
    ├── chrome.manifest
    ├── install.rdf
    └── ... (other files and directories)
~~~
